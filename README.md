![3D Rubik's Cube](3D%20RUBIKâ€™S%20CUBE%20(1).png)
Overview
This project is a comprehensive Rubik's Cube simulator and solver implemented in Delphi. It provides an immersive experience of interacting with a virtual Rubik's Cube, including rotating individual layers, drawing each cubie individually, and employing various algorithms for solving the cube.

Features
Interactive Rubik's Cube: Users can manipulate the Rubik's Cube through buttons, rotating each layer individually in both directions.
Realistic Rendering: The project leverages advanced graphics techniques to draw each cubie individually, creating a visually stunning representation of the Rubik's Cube.
Painter's Algorithm: To ensure proper rendering, the Painter's Algorithm is employed, guaranteeing that cubies are drawn in the correct order to prevent visual artifacts.
Rotation Algorithms: Rodrigues' rotation formula is utilized for rotating cubies around a given axis, providing accurate and efficient transformations, and allowing for proper layer rotation after rotating the whole cube.
Matrix Operations: The project incorporates matrix operations, visualizing each layer as a 3x3 matrix with an index pointing to a specific cubie.
Technologies Used
Delphi: The project is developed in Delphi, although this is not the last version of the software, it serves as a tool for proper rendering and 3D programming understanding.
Graphics Programming: Advanced graphics programming techniques are utilized for rendering the Rubik's Cube and implementing rotation algorithms.
Algorithm Design: The project involves the design and implementation of various algorithms, including sorting, solving, and transformation algorithms.
How to Use
Users can clone the repository and compile the project using Delphi IDE. Upon running the application, they will be presented with a virtual Rubik's Cube interface, where they can interact with the cube using mouse controls.
